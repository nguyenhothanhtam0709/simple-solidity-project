## **Introduction**
My first project to learn Solidity programming language. See the tutorial at this blog [How To Set Up A Solidity Project And Create Your First Smart Contract](https://blog.oliverjumpertz.dev/how-to-set-up-a-solidity-project-and-create-your-first-smart-contract)

## **Script**
See blow about all script can be used in this project.
* To build .sol file, run `yarn build`
* To test the contract, run `yarn test`
* To run a local testnet, run `yarn local-testnet`
* To deploy contract to local testnet, run `yarn deploy:local`
* To deploy contract to local rinkeby testnet, run `yarn deploy:rinkeby`
